# Verify GitHub issue acceptance criteria

Issue-linked work needs **three** gates:

1. **Spec sync** — body-hash drift check (below); issue remains authoritative, `spec.md` is derived reference.
2. **Issue AC** — this skill: each acceptance criterion verified with evidence.
3. **Repo quality** — [developer/done-checklist.md](../developer/done-checklist.md) + [code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md): tests, done gates, policy, smells.

Do not skip (2) or (3) after (1). Do not declare an issue done based on green CI alone if AC were never mapped.

## Goal vs Task / Epic modes

Product governance splits GitHub issues into layers. Detect mode from labels (`type:goal` | `type:epic` | `type:task`) or body sections.

| Mode | Labels | What to verify | Spec `Source:`? |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Goal** | `type:goal` | Outcome / **Success looks like** + child delivery issues | **Never** — Goals are never `Source:` |
| **Epic / Task** | `type:epic`, `type:task`, or default eng issue | Implementer AC (`- [ ]`, Done when) + body-hash | **Yes** — `Source: #<task-or-epic>` |
| **Bug / chore** | GitHub type **Bug**, `type:chore` | Bug expected behavior / chore checklist | Usually no `feat/` spec |

**Goal mode rules:**

- Do **not** invent eng AC from Outcome prose.
- Check **Success looks like** as observable product outcomes; map children (sub-issues / Delivery links) and verify those with Task/Epic mode (or note them as open).
- **Fulfilled** (Product Project Status) is a **product judgment** against success signals — **not** “all children closed,” not green CI on an unrelated PR, and not automatic from delivery issue state.
- Moving a Goal to Fulfilled / closing it for the intended slice requires those success signals met — child progress is evidence, not the definition of done.
- `feat/` work that closes delivery must link a **Task or Epic**, never a Goal as the sole closing issue.
- Goal Status while building stays **Adopted**; eng progress lives on Epics/Tasks.

**Task / Epic mode:** keep the AC + body-hash workflow below.

Product intent: [docs/product/](../../../docs/product/), [GOVERNANCE.md](../../../GOVERNANCE.md). Spec layers: [specs/README.md](../../specs/README.md).

## When to use

| Use | Skip |
|-----|------|
| User or plan references an issue (`#123`, issue URL) | Drive-by fix with no issue |
| Before handoff: "is this done?", "verify the issue" | Pure refactor with no AC |
| Before PR when PR fixes/closes an issue | Docs-only typo with obvious scope |
| Parent after multitask merge for issue-scoped feature | Issue has no criteria and user did not ask for verification |
| Goal issue: success signals + children status | Treating a Goal as `Source:` for `spec.md` |

## Prerequisites

- Issue number or URL (e.g. `#80`, `https://github.com/ORG/REPO/issues/80`)
- Local branch or diff containing the implementation
- `gh` authenticated for the repo ([git-workflow](../git-workflow/SKILL.md) — use `gh` for GitHub tasks)

## Spec drift check (body-hash)

Before AC verification on `feat/` work (or when `.agents/specs/<N>-*/spec.md` exists):

**Do not use `issue.updatedAt`** — labels, assignees, comments, and bots change it without scope changes.

```bash
# Current body hash (full output; compare first 8 hex chars)
gh issue view <N> --json body --jq .body | shasum -a 256

# Stored hash from spec header
grep '^Source:' .agents/specs/<N>-<slug>/spec.md
```

**Interpretation:**

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| No `spec.md` on `feat/` branch | `DRIFT: spec missing` — create spec from issue before handoff |
| First 8 chars of current hash ≠ hash in `Source:` line | `DRIFT: re-sync spec from issue` — read issue body, update spec/plan/tasks, new body-hash |
| Hashes match | `SYNC OK` |

On `DRIFT`: stop and re-sync from issue (issue first, then spec/plan/tasks). Callable MCP drift tool is a follow-up — these commands are the source of truth in PR 2.

Details: [specs/README.md](../../specs/README.md).

## Workflow (one pass)

### 1. Fetch the issue

From repo root (`gh` uses the current repository):

```bash
gh issue view <N> --json number,title,body,state,labels,url,closedAt
gh issue view <N> --comments          # optional — AC sometimes added in comments
```

Find linked PRs (if verifying an existing PR branch):

```bash
gh pr list --search "#<N> in:body" --state all --json number,title,url,state,headRefName
gh pr view <PR> --json body,commits,files   # when a specific PR is in scope
```

Read title + body + relevant comments. Note **state** (`OPEN`/`CLOSED`) but verify AC yourself — do not assume closed means satisfied.

### 2. Extract acceptance criteria

**If Goal mode** (`type:goal`): extract **Success looks like** bullets and list linked children under Delivery / sub-issues. Do not treat Outcome/Who/Non-goals as eng AC. Report child status separately. Verdict for Fulfilled / Goal satisfaction is product judgment on those success signals — closing every child is neither necessary nor sufficient by itself.

**If Task / Epic / Bug mode:** pull every **testable** requirement into a numbered list. Sources, in order:

| Source | How to extract |
|--------|----------------|
| **Acceptance criteria** section | Headings: `Acceptance criteria`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `AC`, `Done when`, `Definition of done`, `Requirements` |
| **Task lists** | Markdown `- [ ]` / `- [x]` lines (GitHub task lists) |
| **Bug template fields** | `expected` / "What should happen instead" from [bug-report.yml](../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml) |
| **Description bullets** | Imperative bullets that state observable outcomes |
| **Linked docs** | Paths or skill links in the issue (e.g. `apps-ui/components.md` acceptance block) |

**Rules:**

- One row per criterion — split compound bullets ("add X and Y") into separate rows when they verify independently.
- Mark inferred criteria with `(inferred)` when there is no explicit AC section.
- If the issue is vague, list assumptions you are verifying and flag gaps in the report — do not silently invent scope.
- Never invent REST/package AC from a Goal’s Outcome section.

### 3. Map each criterion to verification

For every criterion, pick one primary method and record the planned check:

| Method | When | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Test command** | Issue mentions tests, behavior, API, hooks | `pnpm --dir packages/apps exec vitest run path/to.test.ts` |
| **Done gate** | Merge-ready / policy-level bar | `pnpm test:apps-done-gate`, `pnpm test:api-done-gate` |
| **Code inspection** | Structural rule, no test yet | `rg pattern packages/apps/src/…`, read named files |
| **OpenAPI / contract** | REST shape or endpoint | Diff `openapi.json`; feature test filter |
| **Storybook / manual** | UI state, a11y, visual | Mock-tier story exists; `pnpm dev:ui` + steps from issue |
| **Docs** | README / skill update requested | File exists; section matches AC |

Load domain depth when mapping: [testing](../testing/SKILL.md), [api](../api/SKILL.md), [apps-ui](../apps-ui/SKILL.md), [storybook](../storybook/SKILL.md).

**Planning:** If work was planned with [plan-feature](../plan-feature/SKILL.md), align chunk `done-when` / `Verify with` rows to these criterion IDs. Map AC to the **issue**, not to `spec.md` — spec is technical scope reference only.

### 4. Run checks and collect evidence

Run the mapped commands and inspections. For each criterion record:

- **Status:** `PASS` | `FAIL` | `PARTIAL` | `BLOCKED` | `N/A`
- **Evidence:** command output summary, file path, test name, or grep result (one line)
- **Gap:** what is missing when not `PASS`

Then run the package-appropriate rows from [done-checklist.md](../developer/done-checklist.md) (smells via [code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md)).

### 5. Report

Use this template in handoff, PR body (when user asks), or parent agent summary:

```markdown
## Issue verification — #<N> <title>

**Issue:** <url>  
**Branch / PR:** <name or PR url>  
**Issue state:** OPEN | CLOSED (verified independently)

### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | … | PASS | `vitest …` green; `path/file.test.ts` |
| 2 | … | FAIL | missing mock-tier story for `ExportName` |
| 3 | … | PARTIAL | API test passes; UI story not added |

### Inferred / assumed (if any)

- …

### Repo quality gate

- [ ] [done-checklist](../developer/done-checklist.md) commands run for touched packages
- [ ] [smells](../clean-code/smells.md) scan on touched files

### Verdict

`ISSUE_SATISFIED` | `ISSUE_NOT_SATISFIED` | `ISSUE_PARTIAL`

**Blockers:** …  
**Follow-ups:** …
```

**Verdict rules:**

- `ISSUE_SATISFIED` — every criterion `PASS` or `N/A`; no blockers; done-checklist satisfied for scope.
- `ISSUE_PARTIAL` — only `N/A` or documented out-of-scope nits; at least one `PARTIAL` with user-approved deferral.
- `ISSUE_NOT_SATISFIED` — any `FAIL` or `BLOCKED` on a required criterion, or done-checklist not run.

Do not close the issue or claim "fixes #N" unless the user asked and verdict is `ISSUE_SATISFIED`.

## Integration with other skills

| Phase | Skill |
|-------|-------|
| Issue → spec → plan → tasks | [plan-feature](../plan-feature/SKILL.md) + [specs/README.md](../../specs/README.md) |
| Plan chunks from issue AC | Copy AC into chunk `done-when`; engineering rows in `tasks.md` |
| Implement | Domain skills (`api`, `apps-ui`, …) |
| Spec sync gate | **verify-issue** — body-hash drift (this doc) |
| Issue AC gate | **verify-issue** (this doc) |
| Technical gate | [code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md) → [done-checklist](../developer/done-checklist.md) |
| Multitask merge | [multitask-verifier](../developer/multitask-verifier.md) for cross-chunk; then verify-issue for the parent issue |
